This tutorial teaches ML analytics with a series of hands-on labs (HOLs) using the [Data Science](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-science/using/data-science.htm) service in [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](https://cloud.oracle.com/).

You'll learn how to get data from some public data sources, then how to analyze this data using some of the latest ML techniques. In the process, you'll perform Data Analysis, build ML models and make predictions about the time when it's most optimal to pit.

## Getting Started

There is some infrastructure that must be deployed before you can enjoy this tutorial.  See the [Terraform documentation](./terraform/README.md) for more information.

After you've completed the OCI registration process, proceed with the [pit strategy workshop.](./hols/pitstrategy/intro/intro.md)

### Prerequisites

You must have an **OCI** account. [Click here](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/?source=:ow:o:s:nav::DevoGetStarted&intcmp=:ow:o:s:nav::DevoGetStarted) to create a new cloud account.

This solution is designed to work mainly within OCI Data Science, allowing you to quickly be up-and-running:
