# Model Deployment

## Introduction

After we have extracted and analyzed our datasets, it's time to merge them into a more complete file/dataset that combines the characteristics of the smaller files we already have. Then, we will use this merged dataset as an input to our Machine Learning models.

Estimated Lab Time: 20 minutes

### Prerequisites

* An Oracle Free Tier, Paid or LiveLabs Cloud Account
* Active Oracle Cloud Account with available credits to use for Data Science service.
* [Previously created](https://github.com/oracle-devrel/redbull-pit-strategy/blob/dev/hols/pitstrategy/infra/infra.md) OCI Data Science Environment


## Task 1: Merging Weather and Lap Data -> df_lapWeather

## Conclusions

In this chapter, we have:
- Visualized data

Let's proceed to the next chapter, where we'll create a Machine Learning model from our dataset, see which variables are indeed useful and which aren't, and get ready to deploy this Machine Learning model to the Internet.

You may now [proceed to the next lab](#next).
